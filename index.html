       Artist Statement: Look At It Through My Eyes

       it’s a series of photo collage images created to represent social issues that everyone knows and talks about. In this project I put together various photos and textures to show the people how I see a couple of social issues that surround our everyday lives. The style of these pieces is heavily inspired by different art movements and artists that revolutionized the meaning of art. I believe that symbolism plays a big role in some of the greatest pieces of art that put a hidden meaning behind them such as the Monalisa or The Garden of Earthly Delights, to mention a few. This is a way for me to visualize all the conversations I’ve had with friends and family.
